## About

I'm a student from **SMPN 1 Purworejo** who enjoys building things that actually work.  
Interested in **web engineering**, **developer tools**, and **mathematical problem solving**.

I like clean architecture, small CLIs, and projects that solve real annoyances.  
Memorization bores me. Logic doesn’t.

- 🌐 Web development (frontend & backend)
- 🧠 Building tools, frameworks, and libraries
- 🧮 Mathematics & problem solving
- 🐍 Python and JavaScript ecosystems

## Tech I Actually Use

**Languages**
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- Python  
- Go (for tooling & CLI experiments)

**Frontend**

## Selected Projects

- **jspackr**  
  A fast JavaScript bundler CLI built on top of esbuild

> I prefer fewer projects with real purpose over many half-finished demos.

## Fun Notes

- Learned programming mostly from curiosity, not courses.
- Enjoys breaking things just to understand why they break.
- Long-term goal: build software that people actually rely on.
